# ABOUT

## BACKGROUND

This is a Ruby on Rails version of the Greenfoot project back-end created at the Women Who Code Austin 5th Diversity Hackathon in September 2019. The group I worked with created the original project using Node.js and Express; I want to create a Ruby on Rails version because I want more practice creating a RoR API-only app.

I had a lot of fun working with a team to start this project; none of us had participated in a hackathon before and it was great to try something new along with the rest of my team. I'm much more familiar with Ruby on Rails than I am with Node.js (and I have no doubt that my Rails habits spilled over into the Node.js setup!), so it was a good challenge to try out a different language and framework than I usually work with.

You can [see the original repo on GitHub here](https://github.com/Diversity-Hackathon/divhack-backend). It's running on Heroku at https://greenfoot-hackathon.herokuapp.com/, although the routes are not well-documented at the moment.

A huge thanks goes out to [Women Who Code Austin](https://www.womenwhocode.com/austin) for organizing the event and to everyone who participated.

## TECH STACK

This version uses Rails 6.0 and Ruby 2.6, and it has a Postgresql database. The original version was built using Node.js 12.1 and Express 4.14, also with a Postgresql database.

# TODO

* Create requirements list and documentation
* Set up basic authentication and security
* Create controllers
* Set up the database to track users and their logs of trips
* Find APIs to track mileage for different modes of transportation
* Host on Heroku
* TBD as requirements are solidified
